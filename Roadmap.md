The roadmap has been updated with your new requirements. Here's the refined structure:

### **Updated Portfolio Website Roadmap**

---

### **Phase 1: Planning and Design**

- [ ] Define the website structure and layout:
  - **Homepage**: Highlight expertise in ML, Generative AI, and Cloud Engineering (AWS, GCP, Azure).
  - **Certificates Section**: Incorporate AI-powered filtering for skill categorization.
  - **Projects Section**: Include detailed showcases for mini (ML models, cloud projects) and major projects.
  - **Interactive AI Model**: Provide tailored ML concepts, visuals, and quizzes based on user age.
  - **Contact Section**: Links to LinkedIn, GitHub, cloud profiles, and a contact form.
- [ ] Create wireframes for all sections, ensuring seamless integration of AI features.
- [ ] Select the technology stack:
  - **Frontend**: React.js + Tailwind CSS for modern UI/UX.
  - **Backend**: Node.js/Express.js for handling APIs and certificate processing.
  - **Database**: MongoDB for storing certificates, projects, and user data.
  - **AI Integration**: TensorFlow.js or PyTorch.js for in-browser ML models.
  - **Hosting**: AWS Amplify, Vercel, or Firebase.
