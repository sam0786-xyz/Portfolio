- [ ] Validate responsiveness on different screen sizes.
- [ ] Optimize website performance (image compression, code minification).
- [ ] Deploy the website on the selected platform.

## Phase 5: Maintenance and Updates

- [ ] Regularly update certificates and projects.
- [ ] Improve UI/UX based on user feedback.
- [ ] Ensure all links and features remain functional.

## Extras (Optional)

- [ ] Add analytics to track visitors.
- [ ] Include a blog or news section for updates.
- [ ] Implement user authentication for private content (e.g., unpublished projects).

**Estimated Timeframe**:

- **Planning and Design**: 1 week
- **Development**: 3-4 weeks
- **Testing and Deployment**: 1 week
- **Maintenance**: Ongoing

#### **Frontend**

1. **Framework/Library**: React.js (component-based architecture for scalability and reusability).
2. **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (modern, utility-first CSS framework).
3. **Additional Tools**:
   - Framer Motion (for animations).
   - Axios (for API calls).

#### **Backend**

1. **Framework**: Node.js with Express.js (lightweight and efficient).
2. **API**: RESTful API with well-documented endpoints (or GraphQL for advanced querying).
3. **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication (optional for login functionality).

#### **Database**

1. **Database**: MongoDB (NoSQL, highly scalable for certificates and projects data).
2. **ORM**: Mongoose (simplified interaction with MongoDB).

#### **Hosting**

1. **Frontend**: Vercel (great for React projects, auto-deployment).
2. **Backend**: Render or Heroku (scalable and beginner-friendly).
3. **Database**: MongoDB Atlas (cloud database).

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### **Step 1: Setup**

1. Install **Node.js** and initialize the project:
   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```
2. Install required tools:
   ```bash
   npm install react react-dom react-scripts tailwindcss framer-motion axios
   npm install express mongoose cors dotenv
   ```
3. Set up Tailwind CSS:
   - Install and configure Tailwind:
     ```bash
     npx tailwindcss init
     ```
   - Add Tailwind directives to your CSS file:
     ```css
     @tailwind base;
     @tailwind components;
     @tailwind utilities;
     ```

#### **Step 2: Build the Frontend**

1. **Create Basic Structure**:
   - `/src/components` for reusable components.
   - `/src/pages` for individual sections (e.g., Homepage, Certificates, Projects).
2. **Build Sections**:
   - Start with the **Homepage**: Add a professional photo, bio, and links.
   - Use reusable components for the **Navbar** and **Footer**.
3. **Add Styling**:
   - Use Tailwind classes for responsive and modern UI.
   - Add animations with Framer Motion.

#### **Step 3: Backend Development**

1. **Set Up Express Server**:

   ```javascript
   const express = require("express");
   const cors = require("cors");
   const app = express();
   app.use(cors());
   app.use(express.json());

   app.listen(5000, () => console.log("Server running on port 5000"));
   ```

2. **Connect to MongoDB**:

   ```javascript
   const mongoose = require("mongoose");
   mongoose.connect("your-mongodb-uri", {
     useNewUrlParser: true,
     useUnifiedTopology: true,
   });
   ```

3. **Define Models** (e.g., Certificate, Project):

   ```javascript
   const certificateSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
     title: String,
     description: String,
   });
   const Certificate = mongoose.model("Certificate", certificateSchema);
   ```

4. **Create API Routes**:
   ```javascript
   app.get("/certificates", async (req, res) => {
     const certificates = await Certificate.find();
     res.json(certificates);
   });
   ```

#### **Step 4: Integrate Frontend and Backend**

1. **Fetch Data**:

   - Use Axios in React to call backend APIs:
     ```javascript
     axios
       .get("http://localhost:5000/certificates")
       .then((response) => setCertificates(response.data));
     ```

2. **Display Data**:
   - Map over data to render components (e.g., Certificate cards).

#### **Step 5: Deployment**

1. **Deploy Frontend** on Vercel:
   ```bash
   vercel deploy
   ```
2. **Deploy Backend** on Render/Heroku:

   - Push the backend to GitHub and link to the hosting platform.
   - Configure MongoDB Atlas for the database.

3. **Link Frontend to Backend**:
   - Update API URLs to the deployed backend's URL.

### Best Practices

- Use `.env` for sensitive information (e.g., MongoDB URI).
- Test APIs with tools like Postman.
- Validate user input on both frontend and backend.
- Ensure responsive design for mobile devices.
- Optimize images with tools like TinyPNG.

#### Timeline for Each Step

1. **Setup**: 1 day.
2. **Frontend**: 1.5 weeks.
3. **Backend**: 1 week.
4. **Integration**: 3 days.
5. **Deployment**: 2 days.
